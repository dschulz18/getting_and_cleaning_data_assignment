# Week 4 Assignment

This repository was set up to complete the Week 4 assignment of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course. It contains an analysis script called 'run_analysis.R' which was used to create a tidy dataset from the original dataset, the output tidy dataset 'tidy_data.txt', and the 'CodeBook.md' file detailing the data.
